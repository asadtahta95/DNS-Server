# DNS_SpeedTest
A bash script that tests ping time for common DNS servers

Download, and run ./dnsspeedtest.sh. If you are on Windows 10, the Bash for Windows should work as well.

Feel free to add any dns servers you come across, I just looked up a few of the more common ones. The only ting I ask is to maintain the same format in the dnstest.txt file for clean output when the program is run.

Thanks!
